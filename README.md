This is a simple Laravel + Vue.js application 
    
    User Registration/Authentication
        ‚Ä¢ Users are able to register an account and log in using Laravel‚Äôs built-in authentication
        system.
        ‚Ä¢ Only authenticated users can use the system(create, view, and interact with posts).
    Post Creation and Management
        ‚Ä¢ Users are able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own posts.
        ‚Ä¢ Each post include:
            ‚Ä¢ Title
            ‚Ä¢ Content (text body)
            ‚Ä¢ Creation Date and Time
            ‚Ä¢ The Author‚Äôs Name (auto-assigned based on the logged-in user).
        ‚Ä¢ Posts are assigned to one or more predefined categories. For
        example, categories might include "Technology," "Health," or "Lifestyle."
        ‚Ä¢ Only the author of a post can edit or delete their own post.
    Categories
        ‚Ä¢ Categories are predefined (seeded) and cannot be edited or added by users.
        ‚Ä¢ Posts can belong to multiple categories, and categories can
        include multiple posts.
        ‚Ä¢ Users are able to filter posts in the main feed by category.
    Comments
        ‚Ä¢ Users are able to comment on posts.
        ‚Ä¢ Only registered users can add or delete their own comments.
        ‚Ä¢ Comments display the author‚Äôs name and the date/time they were posted.
    User Profile
        ‚Ä¢ Each user has a profile page where their own posts are displayed.
        ‚Ä¢ A profile page should only show posts created by the profile owner, ordered by the most recent
        first.
    Main Feed
        ‚Ä¢ The main feed should display posts from all users, including the post's title, content preview,
        author‚Äôs name, categories, and the number of comments.
        ‚Ä¢ Users should be able to filter posts by category and see posts from all categories by default.
        Search Functionality
        ‚Ä¢ Users should be able to search posts by keywords found in the post's title or content.
        ‚Ä¢ The search results should include posts that match the search term in their title or body content.
    Security & Access Control
        ‚Ä¢ Input Validation: All user inputs are validated before processing. Posts have a
        valid title, content, and assigned categories.
        ‚Ä¢ Middleware for Access Control: Laravel‚Äôs Middleware is used to ensure:
        	‚Ä¢ Only the author of a post can edit or delete their post.
        	‚Ä¢ Only the author of a comment can delete their comment.
        ‚Ä¢ XSS Prevention: All user inputs and displayed data are sanitised to prevent cross-site
            scripting (XSS) attacks.
        
    Key Features:
        ‚Ä¢ Users can create posts with titles, content, and assign multiple predefined categories.
        ‚Ä¢ Users can view and filter posts by category in the main feed.
        ‚Ä¢ Users have profiles displaying their posts.
        ‚Ä¢ Users can post comments on others' posts and delete their own comments.
